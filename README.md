# MLX90621

Basic Arduino sketch to initialize Melexis' MLX90621 4 x 16 IR array, properly convert the measured 15-18-bit IR data to temperature, and then output the temperature on the serial monitor and on an TFT display. With temperature accurate to ~1 degree C, the 120-degree-wide field of view, and a refresh rate up to 512 Hz, the MLX90621 can form that basis of a poor man's FLIR temperature video camera. A pcb useful for mounting the MLX90621 is [for sale](https://www.tindie.com/products/) at Tindie.
